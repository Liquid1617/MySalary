# Budget Feature Fix Instructions

The budget creation error was caused by missing backend API endpoints. I've created the necessary files to fix this issue.

## CRITICAL BUG FIX - Budget Category Tracking Issue

A critical data type conversion bug was discovered in the budget update API that prevented expense tracking from working correctly after editing budgets. This has been fixed.

## What was done:

### Initial Implementation:
1. **Created `/server/routes/budgets.js`** - API endpoints for budget CRUD operations
2. **Created migration `/server/db/migrations/20250719000000-update-budget-structure.js`** - Updates the database schema to match our requirements
3. **Updated `/server/db/models/budget.js`** - Updated the Budget model to match new structure
4. **Created `/server/db/models/budgetcategory.js`** - New model for many-to-many relationship between budgets and categories
5. **Updated `/server/app.js`** - Added budgets route to the Express app

### Critical Bug Fix:
6. **Fixed `/server/routes/budgets.js`** - Fixed data type conversion bug in PUT /budgets/:id route that was storing category IDs as strings instead of integers
7. **Created migration `/server/db/migrations/20250120000001-fix-budget-category-data-types.js`** - Cleans up existing string category IDs and adds data integrity constraints
8. **Enhanced `/server/db/models/budgetcategory.js`** - Added model-level validation and hooks to ensure data integrity

## Steps to apply the fix:

1. **Stop the server** if it's running (Ctrl+C in the terminal)

2. **Run the migrations** to update the database structure and fix existing data:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```
   
   This will run both the original budget structure migration and the new data integrity fix migration.

3. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Reload the app** in your simulator/device

## What changed in the database:

- Budget table now supports:
  - Multiple categories per budget (many-to-many relationship)
  - `name` field for budget names
  - `limit_amount` instead of `planned_amount`
  - `currency` field
  - `period_type` with values: 'month', 'week', 'custom'
  - `rollover` boolean flag
  - Custom date fields are now optional (only required for custom period type)

## Testing:

After restarting the server, you should be able to:
1. Create new budgets with multiple categories
2. View budgets in the carousel
3. Edit existing budgets
4. Delete budgets
5. Navigate to Analytics > Budgets segment

The error "JSON Parse error: Unexpected character: <" should no longer occur.

## What was the budget category tracking bug?

The bug occurred in the PUT /budgets/:id route where category IDs were being stored as strings instead of integers in the BudgetCategories table. This caused the expense tracking query to fail because:

1. **Budget creation** (POST route) correctly converted category IDs to integers using `parseInt(categoryId)`
2. **Budget update** (PUT route) was storing category IDs as strings without conversion
3. **Expense tracking** query used `WHERE category_id IN [3,4]` which failed to match string category IDs

This meant that after editing a budget's categories, the expense tracking would stop working, showing incorrect spent amounts (usually $0) even when expenses existed in those categories.

## Updated Testing Instructions:

After restarting the server, test the complete budget flow:

### Basic CRUD Testing:
1. Create new budgets with multiple categories
2. View budgets in the carousel on FinancesScreen
3. Edit existing budgets and change their categories
4. Delete budgets
5. Navigate to Analytics > Budgets segment

### Critical Bug Fix Testing:
1. **Create a budget** with specific expense categories (e.g., "Продукты", "Транспорт")
2. **Add some expenses** in those categories through the app
3. **Verify the budget shows correct spent amount** in both FinancesScreen carousel and StatisticsScreen
4. **Edit the budget** and change the categories (add/remove categories)
5. **Add more expenses** in the new categories
6. **Verify the budget still shows correct spent amounts** after the edit

The bug would previously cause step 6 to fail - budgets would show $0 spent even with existing expenses after editing categories.
